This is an alternative Homey app for for Nuki Smart Lock 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 (Pro) and Nuki Opener. Differently from The Nuki app by Athom that relies on the Nuki cloud service for controlling your devices, Nuki Direct uses nothing but your local network for communications between your Homey and your Nuki devices via Nuki Bridge (internet access is optionally used for simplifying the initial pairing of a device). When a Nuki device changes its state, it will notify the new state directly to Homey. When Homey issues a command to a Smart Lock or to an Opener, it will send the request directly to the device.  
So, benefits of this approach over the cloud approach are:
* No internet connection needed for communication between Homey and Nuki.
* Improved reliability: it does work even if the internet is down or the Nuki cloud service is temporarily unavailable.
* Quick responsiveness thanks to the direct communication: the faster Homey knows about a state change, the better Homey can serve us.
* Simpler code, smaller memory footprint.

Nuki Direct can also manage the extra features provided by Nuki API in addition to the standard commands, settings, capabilities and flow cards supplied by Homey. With Nuki Direct you can fine-tune the settings and control the specific lock states and events of your Nuki devices.

Since Nuki Direct and Nuki app by Athom have been developed with distinct frameworks, they can happily run side by side on the same Homey without interfering.
